/*
In java either the attributes or methods are public or static.

If a method is created using static, it can be accessed within a class without creating an object of the class.
But public can only be accessed with the help of an object.

Class can be either Public or Default.

Access modifier:
Public -is an access modifier. Public is accessed by all classes.
Default - can only be accessed by classes within the same package.
Private - can be accessed within in the same declared class.
protected - can be accessed within in the same package and sub-classes.

Non-Access modifier:
final - once associated to an identifier/method, it cannot be inherited or modified.
abstract - abstract is used for class and methods. Abstract method can only be created under an abstract class.
An abstract method does not have a body and is provided by the subclass.
** abstract cannot used for a modifier but just for methods and classes.
